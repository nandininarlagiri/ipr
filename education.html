        <h2 >INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <P>
        Education is fundamental for achieving full human potential, developing an equitable and just 
        society, and promoting national development. Providing universal access to quality education is the 
        key to India’s continued anscent, and leadership on the global stage in terms of economic growth, 
        social justice and equality, scientific advancement, national integration, and cultural preservation. 
        Universal high-quality education is the best way forward for developing and maximizing our 
        country's rich talents and resources for the good of the individual, the society, the country, and the 
        world. India will have the highest population of young people in the world over the next decade, and 
        our ability to provide high-quality educational opportunities to them will determine the future of our 
        country.</P>

            <h3>National Education Policy 2020</h3>
            <p>
                Education Policy lays particular emphasis on the development of the creative potential of each 
                individual. It is based on the principle that education must develop not only cognitive capacities - 
                both the  ‘ foundational capacities  ’of literacy and numeracy and ‘higher-order’ cognitive capacities, 
                such as critical thinking and problem solving – but also social, ethical, and emotional capacities and 
                dispositions.
            </p>
            <p >
                This National Education Policy envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes 
                directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge 
                society, by providing high-quality education to all, and thereby making India a global knowledge 
                superpower. The Policy envisages that the curriculum and pedagogy of our institutions must 
                develop among the students a deep sense of respect towards the Fundamental Duties and 
                Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and a conscious awareness of one’s roles 
                and responsibilities in a changing world. The vision of the Policy is to instill among the 
                learners a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, 
                and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support 
                responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global 
                well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen.

        <h2>SCHOOL EDUCATION</h2>
        <P >
            Early Childhood Care and Education: The Foundation of Learning 
            Over 85% of a child’s cumulative brain development occurs prior to the age of 6, indicating the 
            critical importance of appropriate care and stimulation of the brain in the early years in order to 
            ensure healthy brain development and growth.
        </P>
        <p >
            ECCE shall be delivered through a significantly 
            expanded and strengthened system of early-childhood education institutions consisting of 
            (a) stand alone Anganwadis; (b) Anganwadis co-located with primary schools; 
            (c) pre-primary schools/sections covering at least age 5 to 6 years co-located with existing primary schools; and 
            (d) stand-alone pre-schools - all of which would recruit workers/teachers specially trained in the curriculum and pedagogy of ECCE.
            Providing regular trained teachers at each stage, special care shall be taken to ensure that no school remains deficient on infrastructure support. The 
            credibility of Government schools shall be re-established and this will be attained by upgrading and 
            enlarging the schools that already exist, building additional quality schools in areas where they do not 
            exist, and providing safe and practical conveyances and/or hostels, especially for the girl children, so 
            that all children have the opportunity to attend a quality school and learn at the appropriate level. 
            Alternative and innovative education centres will be put in place in cooperation with civil society to 
            ensure that children of migrant labourers, and other children who are dropping out of school due to 
            various circumstances are brought back into mainstream education.

        <h2>HIGHER EDUCATION</h2>
        <P >
            Higher education plays an extremely important role in promoting human as well as societal well
            being and in developing India as envisioned in its Constitution - a democratic, just, socially
            conscious, cultured, and humane nation upholding liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice for all. 
            Higher education significantly contributes towards sustainable livelihoods and economic 
            development of the nation. As India moves towards becoming a knowledge economy and society, 
            more and more young Indians are likely to aspire for higher education.
        </P>
        <p>
            This vision of higher education will require, in particular, a new conceptual 
            perception/understanding for what constitutes a higher education institution (HEI), i.e., a university or 
            a college.  A university will mean a multidisciplinary institution of higher learning that offers 
            undergraduate and graduate programmes, with high quality teaching, research, and community 
            engagement. The definition of university will thus allow a spectrum of institutions that range from 
            those that place equal emphasis on teaching and research i.e., Research-intensive Universities, those 
            that place greater emphasis on teaching but still conduct significant research i.e.  Teaching-intensive 
            Universities. Meanwhile, an Autonomous degree-granting College (AC) will refer to a large 
            ultidisciplinary institution of higher learning that grants undergraduate degrees and is  primarily 
            focused on undergraduate teaching though it would not be restricted to that  and it need not be 
            restricted to that and it would generally be smaller than a typical university.
