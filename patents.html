            <h1>Introduction To Patent</h1>
            <p>A patent describes an invention for which the inventor claims the exclusive rights. A registered patent protects commercial inventions, for example, a new product or process. Patents are also used to protect newly engineered plant species or strains, as well. The term patent has generally 20 years from the date of filing for patent rights for all creations/inventions</p>
            <h3>Exactly What Is Patent In IPR</h3>
            <P>A patent is one of the types of Intellectual Property Rights. Many people are unclear about
               the concept of intellectual property rights. The average person assumes that IPR is
               reserved for extremely serious inventors when they hear people discuss it. It is untrue.
               Anything you make with your mind belongs to you and is intellectual property. Such a
               creator's ownership rights over their works are known as intellectual property rights. It is
               as simple as it looks difficult. To claim IPR, you do not need to invent something
               revolutionary. Intellectual property law allows even simple works of art created by children
               to be safeguarded. An intellectual property right is an intangible right. Like normal
               property, you have a right to your intellectual property. An exclusive monopoly is granted
               to the owner of the intellectual property right to profit from the creation. You can decide
               whether to sell it or keep it in reserve. The catch is that only you can decide whether to
               give consent to someone using your intellectual property.</P>
           <p>A patent is a legal document that the government issues to the creator, giving him the
               exclusive right to sell, manufacture, use, and import the invention for a predetermined
               amount of time following the publication of the idea. By limiting who can sell their products
               on their behalf, patents are required by law to safeguard innovators. The sources of the
               phrase “patent” are old French, old Latin, and old English. From the Latin “patentem” and
               French “patente”, which both indicate the open letter, it first appeared in the late 13th
               century. In the 1580s, the phrase took on its current meaning when it was explained as a
               government-issued permit to create and sell a specific good.</p>
           <p>A patent is used in business to develop, promote, and sell a product. For many of the
               products that people purchase, patents are employed. Once a patent application has been
               accepted by the government, it generally lasts for 20 years from the application date. An
               official government letter patent is the document that gives a person or business the sole
               right to sell a product. The patent applicant or seller may start collecting royalties for their
               goods once the patent has been processed and authorized. A royalty is a payment made to
               the creator of a product in exchange for the right to use it; it serves as reimbursement for
               their labor. This might take the form of a television commercial producer paying a
               songwriter royalties for the usage of their music in a commercial. At least until the product
               is released to the market, patents and royalties are typically maintained confidentially by
               firms through solid agreements and trade secrets. Regardless of whether a patent
               application is filed with a provisional or complete specification, all Indian patents have a
               20-year term beginning on the date of filing. The 20-year period, however, starts on the
               date of the international filing for applications submitted under the Patent Cooperation
               Treaty (PCT).</p>

            <h2>Different Types of Patents </h2>
            <P>To protect various types of inventions, various forms of patents are available. Competent
             innovators can use the various patent application types to obtain the legal protection they
             require for their discoveries:</P>
           <div class="patent-type">
           <h3>1.Utility patent</h3>
           <p>When most people hear the word “patent,” they generally  think of inventions covered by
           utility patents. A utility patent is a technical document that describes in great detail how a
           new device, method, or system operates and provides a strong form of protection. A wide
           variety of inventions, including the broom, computers, business procedures, and
           medications, have been protected under this patent. The utility patent duration is 20
           years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="patent-type">
           <h3>2.Design patent</h3>
           <p>This patent protects adornment on a practical object. A design patent, for instance, can
            safeguard the appearance of a shoe or a bottle. The majority of the actual paper is made
            up of images or sketches that depict the useful item’s design. Because a design patent uses
            so few words, they are notoriously challenging to search for. Software businesses have
            recently exploited design patents to safeguard user interface components, even the design
            of touchscreen devices. The design of the invention must be both practical and unique. The
            original Coca-Cola bottle design is an illustration of this kind of patent. The design patent
            duration is 15 years.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="patent-type">
           <h3>3.Plant patent</h3>
           <p>A plant patent is an intellectual property right that safeguards the unique characteristics of a new plant, preventing others from copying, selling, or using it without permission. plant patent grants exclusive rights to inventors who discover or develop novel plant species. The plant
            patent duration is 20 years.</p>
            <p>Plant patent is developed to comply with international agreements, such as the TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). Plant patent ensures adequate protection for plant varieties while recognizing the rights of farmers and breeders.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="patent-type">
            <h3>4.Provisional patent</h3>
            <p>A provisional patent application (PPA) is an initial filing that provides inventors with a 12-month window to secure a filing date for their invention while allowing time for further development. To maintain the benefits of this early filing date, a complete non-provisional patent application must be submitted within the 12-month period.</p>
            <p>Filing provisional patent avoids the formalities associated with a regular patent application. It provides a “patent pending” status, which is advantageous when seeking partners or investors.</p>

        <div class="section">
           <h2>What cannot be patented </h2>
           <p>A novel product or technique must have an innovative step in order to be patentable in
               India. It may also be manufactured or used in the industry. The invention must also satisfy
               certain criteria relating to novelty, innovative step, and industrial applicability in order to be
               patentable. Please go through the criteria of patentability as discussed earlier in this article
               before moving on to “What cannot be Patented in India?”</p>
           <p>Sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Patent Act, 1970 deal with those discoveries or methods that do not fall under the ambit of the Act and therefore are not patentable. The reasons why
               these are not patentable are that sometimes the inventions or discoveries are against the
               public policy, the particular invention or discovery has already existed in nature, meaning
               thereby, that any discovery of living or non-living thing is already existing in nature and is
               known, and invention or discoveries are against the natural laws. The following are some of
               the examples of inventions that cannot be patented:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>A patent cannot be issued for a device that is used for gambling machines, bank lockers,
               or housebreaking. A patent cannot also be granted to software that can help someone
               get into someone’s email by hacking it. These inventions are frivolous in nature and go
               against natural laws.</li>
           <li>Any invention of medical treatment or a method related to medical treatment cannot be
               patented. The reason is that the doctors or surgeons will not be able to perform
               surgeries because they will be worried about patent infringement at that point in time.</li>
           <li> Any discovery or invention cannot be patented if it is against the established natural
               laws or principles. For example, if someone makes a clock that has 10 hours, which is
               divided into 100 minutes and 100 seconds each. It shall go against natural laws or
               universal law.</li>
           <li>This does not apply to all innovations or discoveries, such as Isaac Newton's law of
               gravity or Albert Einstein's relativity formula. Simply put, a scientific theory or a rule of
               nature cannot be patented.</li>
           </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
          <h2>Procedure for getting a patent in India</h2>
          <p>When the application for a patent is filed for the grant of a patent, an examination of the
           application has to be conducted in the Patent Office within 48 months from the date which
           the applicant specifies or from the date the applicant has filed for the grant of a patent. The
           applicant has a chance to address any concerns raised in the first examination report once
           it is released. The applicant must comply with the conditions within 6 months of the initial
           examination report's release; however, the applicant may seek an additional 3 months. If
           the first examination report's conditions are not met within the allotted nine months, the
           application is deemed to have been withdrawn by the applicant. After all objections have
           been resolved and all conditions have been met, the patent is awarded and published in the
           Patent Office Journal.</p>
           <h3>Step 1: Filing provisional application</h3>
           <p>An idea or concept can be filed as a provisional patent application in India. Patent drafting is techno-legal content writing of an invention to be filed in a patent office. The patent drafting follows guidelines laid out by the patent offices and differs from one country to another. After assuring
               hat the invention is patentable, the inventor can proceed for drafting the patent in Indian patent format. Patent Draft format is decided on the basis of content and stage of the invention/innovation. Provisional Patent Drafting and Complete/Non-Provisional Patent Drafting Provisional or non-perma</p>
           <p>An applicant/inventor can file a patent by direct visitation to patent office or direct online filing or through an
               attorney. Provisional Patent, as the word suggests, is not a final legal documentation and is suggested to be
                filed only if the inventor has incomplete information or just an idea andintends to get some time period to develop the product or gain complete information of the invention. Unlike non-provisional patent applications, there are no specific requirements or set guidelines for what has to be included in a Provisional Patent Application.
                The nature of one’s idea- like whether it’s a simple consumer product or a game-changing innovation-has to be taken into account. If it is a simple consumer product one may be able to generate income without ever needing to file a non-provisional application. If it is a game-changing innovation, the person will need a wall of patents to keep others at bay.
                Provisional patent drafting has to be converted into a complete/non-provisional patent within a period of 12 months otherwise
                the patent priority lapses.</p>
           <h3>Step 2: Non-provisional patent drafting</h3>
           <p>Complete patent specification is a legal document filed in the patent office for claiming the rights of an invention and its details. Complete/Non-Provisional Patent
               Drafting is a legal document prepared in techno-legal language and defined by boundaries set by Claims for the invention.The patent draft is a representation in front of the patent office and the decision of the patent office on the grant of the patent will be made based on the draft itself.
               Hence, not doing a patent draft properly may lead to a patent application which does not get a grant or if granted does not help the inventor in stopping competitors
               effectively.Complete Specification should be preferably drafted by experienced patent drafters who first identify the novelty aspects of the invention, defines the primary and
               secondary claims, structural limitations, drawings and details of the drawings and then uses their skills to create an enforceable patent application. The structure way
               of drafting the complete specification is as follows:</p>
           <ul>
           <li><strong>Title of the invention — </strong>Choose a suitable invention title within 15 words which can denote your patent application;
           <li><strong>Technical description —</strong> A brief of which domain the patent application belongs to and specifically what is aimed to solve.</li>
           <li><strong>Background of the invention —</strong> A background of what is conventional patents are, what do the conventional patent applications lack in and how the present complete patent application is solving those drawbacks.</li>
           <li><strong>summary of the invention</strong> — Summary of the complete patent application is generally in the lines with claim and sometimes it is a paraphrasing of the claime
               features and structure of the invention.</li>
           <li><strong>Brief Description of Drawings —</strong> This includes a brief introduction of the drawings which support the claims of the patent application diagrammatically.</li>
           <li><strong>Detailed Description of Drawings —</strong> This section elaborates the drawings in detail to provide an in-depth knowledge of the complete patent application and support
               claims with additional details such as experimental details of the complete patent application and advantage of the patent application.</li>
           <li><strong>Claims -</strong>This section is utterly important and has to drafted in broad manner specifying novel aspects of the complete patent application.</li>
           <li><strong>Abstract of the Invention — </strong>This section is a brief of primary features of the complete patent application.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Step 3: Publication of the application</h3>
           <p>Every patent application which is filed with the Indian patent office is kept as a secret until the time it is published in the official patent journal. Indian patent office will |
               publish patent applications ordinarily after eighteen months. This is an automatic event and you need not make any request. However, if you wish to get your
               application published earlier, you can make a request for early publication (Form 9) and your application will ordinarily be published within one month of the request.
               The date of publication is important as the patentor’s privileges and rights start from the date of publication, although they can’t enforce their rights by way of any
               infringement proceedings until their patent is granted. It is also important to know that there are a few scenarios under which a patent application may not be
               published and kept as a secret:</p>
               <li>Secrecy directions have been imposed under the Patent Act. Secrecy directions are imposed if the invention falls in a category publication of which could be
               against the interest of the nation.</li>
               <li>A complete application was not filed within twelve months from the date of filing of the provisional application.</li>
               <li>Arequest for withdrawal was made. Such a request has to be made at least three months prior to publication. So, for practical purposes, it is fifteen months from
               the date of priority in a standard patent application process.</li>
           <h3>Step 4: Pre grant opposition</h3>
           <p>After publication invitation is available to the public so any person/party interested can file a request to the controller and can oppose the patent by writing an
               application to the controller.Every patent application which is filed for protection has to be substantively examined before a patent is finally granted. The examination process is where your
               patent application will finally be examined on merits of the invention as described and claimed in the patent specification.</p>
           <h3>Step 5 : Examination of the patent application</h3>
           <p>The examination process, unlike publication, doesn’t happen automatically by way of filing of the Indian patent application. The applicant has to specifically make a
               request for examining their patent application (Form 18). Only when a Request for Examination (RFE) is received, will the application be queued for examination. So,
               the earlier one makes the RFE request, the earlier one’s application may be examined by the examiner.If a patentor wishes to fast track their patent application even further and jump the examination queue, they can file a request for expedited examination (Form 18A).
               However, an expedited examination is only available to the applicant if the applicant is either a start-up; or the applicant chose the Indian Patent Office as the
               International Search Authority (ISA) or International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) during their international application (PCT application).
               On the contrary, some patentors may sometimes not want to get their application examined early for strategic reasons. Reasons for deferring the request could
               include extending the patent-pending life, waiting for funding, et cetera.</p>
           <h3>Step 6: Final decision on grant of patent</h3>
           <p>Once, the Request for Examination has been filed, it will eventually land up on the desk of the examiner from the relevant technology background for examination.
               During the examination process, the examiner will scrutinize the application to ensure that the application is in accordance with the Patent Act and Rules. The
               examiner also performs a search to understand similar technologies to ascertain if the invention would satisfy the patentability criteria.Based on the review of the application, the examiner will issue an Examination Report to the applicant, stating the grounds for objections. The first such examination
               report is called the First Examination Report (FER).</p>
               <p>Once, the FER is issued, the patent applicant needs to successfully overcome the objections to receive a patent grant. The whole process may involve responding to
               examination reports, appearing for hearing, etc. The total time needed to put an application in order for the grant is six months (earlier it was twelve months) from the
               date on which the FER is issued to the applicant. However, this six-month period can be extended for a period of three months by the applicant by filing a request for
               an extension of time (Form 4)</p>
               <p>Once, the patent application overcomes all the objections, the patent will be granted and published in the patent gazette.</p>
           <h3>Step 7: Renewal</h3>
           <p>After the patent has been granted, it has to be renewed every year by paying the renewal fee. A patent in India can be renewed for a maximum period of 20 years from
                   the patent filing date.</p>
           <P>The Indian Patent Office has taken the required steps over the past two years to facilitate
               unfettered access to information about application status and granted patents. It is |
               requisite All patented inventions must meet the requirements for patentability. When it
               comes to the investment made in the development of new technology, patents can offer
               both individuals and businesses significant value and higher profits.</P>
