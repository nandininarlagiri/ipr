            <h1> Designs</h1>
                <p>Intellectual property rights are rights that are given to protect the creation of human
            minds. Whenever a new product is created, it is not only the use of the product that guides
            the consumer's decision, but also how that particular product looks. In other words, with
            advancements in science and technology, the market has a large variety of products that
            have the same function but different designs, to which buyers are more attracted. The |
            design of a product can be a unique composition of colours, shapes or patterns that are
            appealing to the eye. In simple words, ‘design’ is a human touch given to any product in
            the form of a composition of colours, shapes, patterns, etc., which adds aesthetic value and
            attraction to the product. Design involves some creativity and distinctiveness, and thus, if
            the shape of a product is due to some function that it needs to perform, then it will not fall
            under the subject of design. Moreover, it includes industrial designs which can be two- |
            dimensional or three-dimensional.</p>
            <p>One must be able to distinguish industrial design from other common forms of intellectual
            property rights. Industrial design is different from copyright, as copyright exists in artistic
            works but is not necessarily applied to an article. For example, a unique sketch by an artist
            acquires copyright, but it becomes a subject matter of design only when such design is
            applied to articles in an industry. Industrial design is different from a patent, as a patent is
            granted for a new product or process, whereas design is granted when it is applied in a
            creative way to an old or new product. Industrial designs are different from trademarks, as
            trademarks are generally symbols used to distinguish one product from other products in
            industry, whereas designs are those aesthetic features in one’s product which are appealing
            to one’s eyes.</p>

            <h2>Laws relating to Industrial Designs in India</h2>
            <p> The need to protect industrial designs was first felt in the 19th century and at that time,
        the<strong>Act No. XV of 1859</strong>  was consolidated to provide protection relating to designs. It was
        then renamed as “The Patterns and Designs Protection Act”. The <strong>Patterns and Designs
        Protection Act, 1872</strong> was enacted to provide protection as well as to grant exclusive rights,
        such as making, using and selling designs associated with the product, for a short period of
        time. This Act augmented the Act of 1859, which the Governor General of India passed in
        order to protect industrial designs and grant privileges to inventors. This Act was replaced
        by the <strong>Inventions and Designs Act,</strong> 1888, which consolidated and amended the law relating
        to the protection of the designs of inventors in a separate part of the Act. After this, the Act
        of 1888 was replaced by the <strong>British Patent and Designs Act, 1907</strong> which forms the basis of
        the current patent law and new design law in India. Thereafter, a need for two separate
        laws was felt, as patents and designs were two different intellectual property rights
        associated with any product. Thus, two separate laws were enacted, namely, the Designs
        Act, <strong>1911 and The Patents Act, 1970.</strong> Most recently, <strong>the Designs Act, 2000</strong> replaced the
        Designs Act,1911, with the objective of protecting designs in India as well as bringing the
        Indian design law at par with international law, which was lacking in the 1911 Act. In all,
        the Designs Act, 2000 consists of about 11 chapters and 48 sections. The Controller-
        General of patents, designs and trademarks under Section 4(1) of the<strong>Trade and
        Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958)</strong>is the Controller of Designs authority for
        registration of designs</p>

       <h2>Features of Design Act, 2000</h2>
       <p>The Designs Act, 2000 is an enactment to consolidate and amend the law relating to the
        protection of designs in India. Its main objective is to protect new or original designs from
        being copied, thereby protecting the proprietor from incurring losses. Following is the list of
        unique features introduced in the Designs Act, 2000:</p>
        <ul>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Adoption of Locarno Classification</strong>
            Under the Designs Act 2000, India adopted the Locarno Classification system. Unlike the
            previous provisions that classified designs based on materials used, the Locarno
            Classification categorises designs solely based on their subject matter. This shift simplifies
            the design registration process and ensures a more efficient classification system.</li>
        <li><Strong>Introduction of absolute novelty.</Strong>
            A significant feature of the Designs Act, 2000 is the introduction of the concept of ‘absolute
            novelty.’ This provision (Section 4) allows the assessment of novelty based on the prior
            publication of any article, not only within India but also in other countries. Designers can
            protect their creations from imitation or unauthorised use, even if they have been disclosed
            in other jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoration of designs</strong>
            The Act includes a provision for restoration of design that was not present in the previous |
            enactment. This provision benefits designers who may have unintentionally missed the
            opportunity to register their designs. Now, they have the opportunity to restore the
            registration and enjoy the associated rights and protections under Section 12 of the
            Designs Act, 2000.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer of cases to high courts</strong>
            The Act empowers district courts to transfer cases to high courts, under Section 22(4) of |
            the Designs Act, 2000, when the validity of a design registration is challenged. This
            provision ensures that such disputes are resolved in the appropriate judicial forum,
            streamlining the legal process and facilitating the resolution of disputes efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegation of powers and duties of examiners</strong>The Designs Act, 2000 includes the delegation of powers of the Controller of Designs to |
            other examiners under Section 3(2) of the Designs Act, 2000. These provisions promote
            transparency, accountability and efficiency within the design registration process, ensuring
            an effective design registration system.</li>
        </ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure for registration of industrial designs</h2>
        <P>The first step of the registration is filing Form 1, which includes necessary details such as
            the name, address and nationality of the applicant/ owner of the design. In the case of a
            company, information regarding the place of incorporation and the legal status of the entity
            is asked in the application form. Another essential entry in the form is regarding the class
            and the sub-class under the Locarno Classification, of the article enclosing the design.
            Along with this, the applicant also needs to mention the name of the product to which the
            design has been applied.</P>
        <P>The form should be submitted along with all the necessary documents and the prescribed
            fee at any branch of the Indian Patent Office (IPO) situated in Ahmedabad, Mumbai,
            Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata. The government fee in India for filing an industrial design is Rs
            1,000 for individuals, startups, and micro, small, and medium enterprises and Rs 4,000 for
            other entity types.</P>
        <P>The following are the necessary documents to be submitted along with the application form
            to get design registration:</P>
        <ul>
        <li> A certified copy of the extract of disclaimers, which mentions what the application does
            not wish to include for protection (or what it wants to exclude).
            For example, if the design consists of lines as well as a combination of colours, then a
            disclaimer saying that the lines are not to be included but only a unique combination of
            colour applied to the article is to be included. This is needed to give a clear picture of what
            is not to be protected.></li>
        <li>Affidavits in relation to declaration of truth and verifiability of design, applied to a
            particular product.></li>
        <li>Other public documents, such as Aadhar card of proprietor, incorporation certificate in
            case of company, a description outlining the article's unique features that make it
            distinctive from other designs present in market, as well as two photographs giving a
            whole view of the article.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Besides this, the Controller of Designs also examines whether the application contains
            accurate details for the prescribed fees. The examination section also mentions the class in
            which the design needs to be registered, and it makes clear that the design can be
            registered only in one class at a time, and if there is confusion of classes, then the
            Controller of Designs decides which class is fit for that particular design. This section also
            makes it clear that the Controller of Designs has sole power to refuse the registration of
            design on reasonable grounds and, at the same time, provides that the proprietor shall
            have the right to appeal in the high court on the ground of refusal by the Controller of
            Design.There can be abandonment of the application if proper details are not provided by the
            designer in specified time. Moreover, this section gives information related to the
            registration date.</p>
        <P>For example, if the proprietor filed for registration on 22nd June, 2017
            and he/she obtained the registration finally on 20th August, 2020, then the design will be
            registered in the register of Controller of Designs on 22nd June, 2017, i.e., the registration
            filing date.The main criteria under which the examiner will be judging the application was reteriated in
            the case of Bright Auto Industries vs. Raj Chawla (1976), the Delhi High Court held that
            just a slight variation in the registered design from a pre-existing design would not qualify
            for registration. In this case, there is a well defined shape of a rear view mirror; just having
            a curve to it will not make it different. Thus, it depends, from case to case, whether slight
            variation will be part of innovation or not.</p>
