        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Gender Discrimination is a situation where someone is put in a disadvantageous position because of their gender and sex. Such discrimination is extensively faced by women across the globe. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 defines discrimination against women as "any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field." Equal rights for women has been a crucial part of the human rights movement and most of the nations are committed towards providing equal opportunities and rights to women. Discrimination free environment is quint essential to safeguard the rights of women. Law plays an important role in achieving&nbsp;this&nbsp;objective. Article 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India stipulates that the State shall not discriminate against anyone on the basis of sex. Apart from these articles, Article 39, 40 and 42 and the Directive Principles of State Policy state certain measures needed to achieve gender equality. The Parliament has enacted several legislations to meet this goal. Some of these are:
            </p><li>Child Marriage Prohibition Act, 1929</li>
            <li>Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</li>
            <li>Maternity Benefits&nbsp;Act,&nbsp;1961</li>
            <li> Equal Remuneration Act, 1976</li>
            <li>The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986</li>
            <li>The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987</li>
            <li>protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</li>

            <h2>Types of Intellectual Property in judiciary</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>The Patents Act, 1970: </strong>The Patents Act, 1970, governs the filing, examination, grant, and enforcement of patents in India. It provides inventors with exclusive rights to their inventions for 20 years, contingent on meeting criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. The Act includes mechanisms for opposition and revocation of patents and offers remedies such as injunctions and damages against infringement​.Patent infringement occurs when an unauthorized party makes, uses or sells a patented invention without the patent holder’s permission. Defending against patent infringement requires a thorough understanding of the patent’s claims and a detailed comparison with the allegedly infringing product or process.India initially had a system of limited patent protection, focusing on processes rather than product patents, 
                especially in sectors like food and pharmaceuticals, to address national concerns such as access to essential 
                drugs and food security. Following the German model of granting only process patents which was subsequently 
                followed by Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland and the 
                U.S.S.R., a committee recommended this approach to benefit the Indian chemical and pharmaceutical 
                industries. The aim was to prevent monopolies on essential items like food and medicine, ensuring they remain 
                affordable and accessible to the public. The Patents Act of 1970 was enacted based on these recommendations, 
                aligning with the national priorities.
            <li><strong>The Trademarks Act, 1999:</strong> The Trademarks Act, 1999, regulates the registration and protection of trademarks in India. It allows for the registration of various types of marks and protects against unauthorized use. The Act provides procedures for opposition and cancellation of trademarks and legal remedies for infringement, including injunctions and damages. Registered trademarks are valid for 10 years, renewable indefinitely​.Trademark infringement cases arise when a party uses a mark that is identical to a registered trademark, leading to consumer confusion. This occurs when one party misrepresents its goods or services as those of another, causing harm to the goodwill of the latter. To succeed in a trademark infringement or passing-off action, the plaintiff must prove ownership of a valid trademark, the likelihood of confusion and damage to their brand reputation. In contrast, in infringement actions, the focus shifts to whether the defendant uses a mark identical to or a 
                colorable imitation of the plaintiff's trademark. The likelihood of confusion is a crucial factor in these cases. 
                Before the replacement of the 1958 Indian Trademarks Act with legislation aligned with India's TRIPS entry, 
                Indian courts had acknowledged the concept of trademark dilution. This concept, now enshrined in the 
                Trademarks Act of 199914, allows for the protection of well-known marks and marks with a distinct reputation 
                in India from unauthorized use in dissimilar goods or services. To succeed in trademark dilution claims, it must 
                be proven that the mark has a reputation in India and that its unauthorized use unfairly benefits another or harms 
                the distinctive character of the mark. Indian courts recognize the trans-border reputation of trademarks, 
                extending protection against dishonest attempts at appropriation.
            <li><strong>The Copyright Act, 1957:</strong> The Copyright Act, 1957, protects original literary, artistic, musical and other intellectual works by granting creators exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform and display their works. The Act recognizes the moral rights of authors and provides remedies for infringement, including injunctions and damages. Copyright protection typically lasts for the author’s lifetime plus 60 years.Copyright infringement involves the unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of a copyrighted work. This can include literary works, music, films, software, and other creative content. Copyright disputes often require a detailed analysis of the originality and substantial similarity between the works in question, making intellectual property disputes in this area particularly challenging.It clarified that copyright does not extend to facts themselves but to the original expression of those facts, 
                emphasizing the commercial implications and the need for creativity in compilations. 
                Furthermore, the Court recognized the significance of international treaties and conventions in shaping 
                copyright laws in India, emphasizing the need to protect copyrights against unauthorized importation of 
                infringing products. The Court underscored the balance between protecting the rights of authors and promoting 
                creativity in copyright law. It also discussed the concept of fair use, acknowledging the transformative nature 
                of using copyrighted works for research and non-commercial purposes.

                </p><h2>The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013</h2>

Interference with work or creating a hostile environment. Humiliating treatment impacting health safety.The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, commonly known as the POSH Act, is a landmark legislation in India designed to protect women from sexual harassment at their workplaces.  It was enacted to address the long-standing issue of workplace sexual harassment and to provide a safe and secure working environment for women.  Prior to this Act, legal recourse for women facing such harassment was often inadequate and fragmented. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment broadly, encompassing unwelcome sexually colored remarks, physical contact and advances, a demand or request for sexual favors, showing pornography, and any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of 1  a sexual nature.  This comprehensive definition acknowledges the various forms that sexual harassment can take, going beyond just physical acts. A key feature of the Act is the mandate for every workplace with ten or more employees to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC).  This committee is responsible for receiving and investigating complaints of sexual harassment.  The ICC typically consists of a presiding officer who is a senior woman employee, other women employees, a member from an NGO or association committed to the cause of women, and an external expert on sexual harassment.For workplaces with less than ten employees, or when the complaint is against the employer himself, the Act provides for a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) at the district level.  The LCC performs similar functions to the ICC, providing a platform for women in smaller workplaces or in specific circumstances to raise their concerns.  </p>
                   The POSH Act lays down a detailed procedure for handling complaints.  Once a complaint is received, the ICC or LCC is required to conduct a preliminary inquiry.  If a prima facie case is established, a formal inquiry is initiated.  The Act emphasizes confidentiality throughout the process to protect the complainant's privacy and dignity.During the inquiry, both the complainant and the respondent are given an opportunity to present their case and provide evidence.  The ICC/LCC has the powers of a civil court to summon witnesses and documents.  The Act mandates that the inquiry be completed within a specific timeframe to ensure timely justice. If the ICC/LCC finds the respondent guilty, it can recommend various actions to the employer, including termination of service, suspension, written apology, or monetary compensation to the complainant.  The Act also provides for appeals against the recommendations of the ICC/LCC.Beyond redressal, the POSH Act emphasizes prevention.  It requires employers to conduct awareness programs and workshops for employees on sexual harassment and their rights.  This proactive approach aims to create a culture of respect and deter acts of sexual harassment.The Act also addresses the issue of false or malicious complaints.  Provisions are in place to ensure that the Act is not misused, while also ensuring that genuine complainants are not discouraged from coming forward due to fear of reprisal.  This balance is crucial for the effective implementation of the Act.
                            The POSH Act represents a significant step forward in protecting women's rights at the workplace in India.  While challenges remain in its implementation and enforcement, the Act provides a legal framework and institutional mechanisms to address sexual harassment and create safer working environments forwomen.
