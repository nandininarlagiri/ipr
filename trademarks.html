        <h1>Trademark </h1>
        <p>Trademark protection is available for certain names, symbols, devices, or words that will be used in connection with a good or service. Technically, if a certain mark is associated with a service, it is called a "service mark," but trademark is commonly used to refer to both marks associated with services  and  goods.  The  purpose  behind  trademarks  is  to  allow  companies  and  individuals  to indicate the source of their goods or services and to distinguish them from others in the industry. There are many different types of distinctive marks that are classified as trademarks A company’s
            name,  a  sporting  team’s  mascot  and  famous  singer’s  lyrics  are  all  considered  trademarks. Trademark can be found in different forms. Some of them are: </p>

            <h2>What Is Trademark Protection?</h2>
            <p>Trademark is viewed as one of the most significant resources of any organization or business house as the good will and success of such company immensely upon the proper commercial exploitation of its trademark. Likewise Trademark additionally is one of the most significant type of Intellectual Property holding an exceptional spot in the whole IPR system considering the huge growth of trade and commerce in the economy.If your reputation for you or your goods and services is what makes the difference for you, then a trade mark is the best form of defence for your reputation. Don’t think that putting the letters after your name is enough they might well serve to stop someone from misusing your brand but the sign does not carry any legal weight in a courtroom fight.</p>
            <p>An additional advantage of a registered trade mark is that you will also be able to defend yourself against ‘cybersquatters’. These are people who buy a domain name incorporating your company name/brand  name and then try to sell it back to you for a large amount of money. By  having a registered trade mark, you are easily able to defend yourself against anyone who uses a similar or identical  domain  to  that  of  your  trade  mark  in  either  the  same  line  of  trade  or  for  fraudulent purposes. Having a distinctive trademark simplifies  marketing and advertising. Once  your  trademark  has become recognizable, it may be all you need to use in your marketing materials. A perfect example is  the  apple  symbol  that  Apple  Inc.  uses.  Everyone  can  identify  the  brand  just  by  seeing  that symbol. Often, Apple Inc. does not even use words in their advertising</p>

            <h2>Types of Trademark </h2>
            <p>Types of Trademark Trademarks  are  of  various types;  product  marks,  service  marks,  collective  marks,  certification marks, shape marks, etc. The purpose of the trademark is the same, irrespective of its type. It allows the consumers to distinguish the source of the product/service and assures the quality of the product or service.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Mark</strong>: A product mark is similar to a trademark. The only difference is, it refers to trademarks related to products or goods and not services. It is used to identify the source of a product and to distinguish a manufacturer’s products from others. On the whole, a trademark is an important means to protect the goodwill and reputation of a Business.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Mark</strong>: A service  mark is the same as a trademark, but instead of a  particular product, it identifies and differentiates the source of a service. For example, a company such as Yahoo may brand certain products with a trademark, but use a service mark on the internet searching service that it provides. It is denoted by "SM".</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Mark</strong>: These  are  the  trademarks  used  by  a  group  of  companies  and  can  be  protected  by  the  group collectively. Collective marks are used to inform the public about a particular characteristic of the product for which the collective mark is used. The owner of such marks may be an association or public institution or it may be cooperative. </li>
            <li><strong>Certification Mark</strong> : It is a  sign indicating that the goods/services are  certified by the owner of the  sign in terms of origin, material, quality, accuracy or other characteristics. This differs from a standard trademark whose function is to distinguish the goods/services that originate from a single company.</li>
