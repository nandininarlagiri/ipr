        <section>
            <h2>Introduction To Copyright</h2>
            <p>Copyright, a combination of "copy" and "right," grants creators the exclusive right to reproduce their original work. It protects various intellectual creations, including literature, music, films, software, and designs, ensuring they cannot be copied without permission. When a work is independently created with originality, it qualifies as an Original Work of Authorship (OWA), automatically giving the creator control over its use. Though copyright primarily safeguards tangible expressions, concepts like slogans, logos, and theories fall under trademarks or patents.</p>
            <p>While copyright protection is automatic, creators can voluntarily register their work to strengthen their legal rights. Registration provides an added advantage in enforcing copyright and filing lawsuits against infringement. By securing their intellectual property, creators and artists can innovate freely, knowing their work is protected from unauthorized replication, ultimately fostering originality and creative growth.</p>
            <h2>Copyright in Different Fields</h2>

            <h3>1.Copyright in Literary Work</h3>

            <p>Literary works are protected by copyright as long as they exist in a tangible form. This includes books, magazines, newspapers, journals, anthologies, novels, computer software, letters, emails, poetry, song lyrics, tables, and compilations. Additionally, abstracts, encyclopedia entries, dictionary meanings, and individual poems also fall under copyright protection, ensuring that original written content remains safeguarded from unauthorized use.</p>

            <h3>Duration of Copyright</h3>

            <p>For literary works, whether published or unpublished, copyright protection lasts for the creator’s lifetime plus 60 years after their death. This extended duration ensures the author's work remains protected and benefits their legal heirs or estate.</p>

            <h3>ownership</h3>
            <p>The author or creator of a literary work is typically considered its rightful owner, holding exclusive rights over its reproduction, distribution, and adaptation unless legally transferred or assigned to another entity.</p>

            <h3>2.Copyright in Dramatics</h3>

            <p>Dramatic works include dance, mime, screenplays, ballets, operas, and more. Copyright protects creators like dramatists, poets, composers, choreographers, and authors from unauthorized replication. Both published and unpublished works, such as pantomimes, plays, treatments, scripts for radio, cinema, and television, with or without music, can be registered.</p>

            <p>Dramatic scripts are meant for performance, including spoken text, plot, and direction. However, not all dramatic works qualify for copyright. Exceptions include program titles and general ideas. Only existing scripts can be copyrighted, not future ones. To register a dramatic work, a manuscript, printed copy, film or video recording, or phonorecord must be submitted to the Copyright Office, with protection starting from the date of submission.</p>

            <h3>3.Copyright in Musical Work</h3>

            <p>Musical work consists of compositions expressed through graphical notations, excluding lyrics or spoken words intended to accompany the music. It protects original musical creations, ensuring they cannot be copied or used without permission.</p>

            <p>The <strong>composer</strong> is the author of the musical work, regardless of whether the music is recorded in any form of notation. They hold the exclusive rights over their compositions, safeguarding their creative efforts.</p>

            <p>The <strong>duration of copyright</strong> extends through the lifetime of the composer and continues for 60 years after their death. In cases of joint authorship, the protection lasts until 60 years after the death of the last surviving author.</p>

            <h3>4.Copyright in Sound Recordings</h3>
            <p>Sound recordings include any form of recorded audio, such as speeches, songs (with or without music), podcasts, or any other audio content. These recordings are protected under copyright law, preventing unauthorized use or duplication.</p>

            <p>The producer is considered the author of a sound recording. They have the right to register themselves as the owner, as the creation is a result of their intellectual efforts.</p>

            <h3>Duration of Copyright</h3>
            <p>Copyright protection generally lasts for 60 years.<br>
                In the case of sound recordings, the duration extends to the lifetime of the producer plus 60 years after their death.</p>
            <h3>5.Copyright in Cinematograph Films</h3>
            <p>Cinematograph films encompass various visual and audio recordings that can be displayed on any medium, allowing moving images to be viewed. This also includes works involving sound recordings, ensuring comprehensive protection under copyright law.</p>
            <h3>Stages of Protection Under Copyright</h3>

            <p><h3>Pre-Production:</h3> Before a film is produced, extensive preparations take place, including casting, scripting, screenplay writing, scheduling, and rehearsals. During this phase, strict legal protection is necessary to prevent unauthorized replication of creative elements.</p>
            <p><h3>Post-Production:</h3> Once a film is released, protecting it from unauthorized copying and distribution becomes essential. Copyright ensures the film remains the intellectual property of its creators and is not misused.</p>
            <h3>Rights of the Owner</h3>

        <h1>Copyright Registration Process</h1>
